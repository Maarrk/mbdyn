Objective:

Minimum: interface for single node in MBDyn & in C::E
MBDyn-side code for MBDyn module
C::E-side code for MBDyn-C::E interface
C::E code for example (e.f. a mass, or a mass and a spring, ...)
Desired: interface for arbitrary number of nodes


First step: the minimum objective;
1. A define element: like the external structural force element, yet without communication tools, such as the sockets or the files; (2-3 weeks)
2. MBDyn-C::E interfaces; (3 weeks)
3. a simple C::E system; (1-2 day)

Schedules:
1. A define element: like the external structural force element, yet without communication tools, such as the sockets or the files; (2-3 weeks)
	1.a. a loadable element like the structural force;
	2.a. a loadable element like the external structural force element, with an inputing force or torque;
