## Project overview
The goal of the project is to enable tight coupling co-simulation between MBDynhttps://www.mbdyn.org and another open-source software, Chrono::Engine(C::E). For that, a user-defined runtime loadable module template is provided. The template includes a MBDyn-C::E interface runtime module, by which users can built their own C::E models in the opaque object, and link it to the MBDynâ€™s module. Several demos are aslo provided as references.
