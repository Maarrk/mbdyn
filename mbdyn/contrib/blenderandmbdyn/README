First, install Blender from www.blender.org and MBDyn from http://www.aero.polimi.it/~mbdyn/
Both of these applications and websites provide extensive installation and usage instructions.

When you have both of these programs working, and you have the executable "mbdyn" accessible by the
Blender application, you can then copy these two Python scripts into a Blender accessible folder,
for instance ~/.blender/scripts if you are on a Debian operating system.

Then start Blender, and in your Python Window click Scripts -> Update Menus.  You will then find the
that the MBDyn script can be run from your Python Window by clicking Scripts -> Animation -> MBDyn
