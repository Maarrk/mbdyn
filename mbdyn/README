MBDyn - MultiBody Dynamics



developers:

  - check out from the CVS tree
  - run "sh ./bootstrap.sh" to generate ancillary files.
    Mmay need some tailoring.  A system with working autoconf, 
    automake and libtool is required; I'm currently using 
    autoconf 2.13, automake 1.4, libtool 1.3.4.
  - tar the tree and move to the target system; this way, all
    the ancillary files wil be available even if the target 
    system does not have those tools.



distribution:

  - follow the above instructions
  - run "make dist"



installation:

  - get a working source tree, either by following the "developers:"
    or the "distribution:" instructions or from the web site
    http://www.aero.polimi.it/~mbdyn
  - configure the package; "./configure" will suffice in most cases,
    unless you need some of the supported packages and they are not 
    in the standard place
  - "make" the package
  - run "make install"; the command "mbdyn" and some utilities will
    be installed in "$PREFIX/bin", while some libraries will be put
    in "$PREFIX/lib".  Those libraries are not required to run either
    mbdyn or the utilities (unless you force the shared build).
