A. Configuration:

	- test for '_' appended to F77 symbols
	- audit all the suite for not-so-GNU systems
	- add test for pow_dd stuff (might be needed by fortran code)



B. Package:

	- add a comprehensite test suite
	- make compliant to GNU style



C. Libraries:

	- add UMFPACK3 sparse matrix library to parallel solution



D. Code:

	Large Projects:
	- implement binary, or hard, restart
	- add MATLAB/Octave and Simulink hooks.
		Large project: turn mbdyn into a module for Simulink.

	Medium Projects:
	- recover exisiting soft restart
	- add MATLAB/Octave and Simulink hooks.
		``matlab'' element that feeds matlab with data structures 
		containing variables and executes matlab code.
	- develop a trim control as an external command that drives
		a simulation.

	Small Projects:
	- add MATLAB/Octave and Simulink hooks.
		``shell'' element, drive and so that executes unix commands 
		including scripts, and especially matlab scripts.
	- move critical Reynolds numbers from constants to fluid properties
		with pressure/temperature dependencies.
	- add symbolic constitutive law (based on GiNaC)
	- move exception handling towards <stdexcept>
	- review/improve user-configurable statistics output



E. Bugs/missing features:

	- check for nested /* */ comments in parsers
	- eliminate nasty dependence from f2c typedefs (doublereal and so)
