A. Configuration:

	- test for '_' appended to F77 symbols (recent autoconf does that)
	- audit all the suite for not-so-GNU systems
	- add test for pow_dd stuff (might be needed by fortran code)



B. Package:

	- add a comprehensive test suite
	- make compliant to GNU style



C. Libraries:




D. Code:

	Large Projects:
	- implement binary, or hard, restart
	- add MATLAB/Octave and Simulink hooks.
		Large project: turn mbdyn into a module for Simulink.
	- remove node/element type listing from "control data" block;
	  use STL containers to keep track of model components

	Medium Projects:
	- recover existing soft restart
	- add MATLAB/Octave and Simulink hooks.
		``matlab'' element that feeds matlab with data structures 
		containing variables and executes matlab code.
	- develop a trim control as an external command that drives
		a simulation.
	- add friction to all joints
	- add Arnoldi-like eigenvalue extraction module
	- review output to allow selective ascii/binary output
	- replace MyLList and LLStack with STL containers

	Small Projects:
	- add MATLAB/Octave and Simulink hooks.
		``shell'' element, drive and so that executes unix commands 
		including scripts, significantly matlab scripts.
	- move critical Reynolds numbers from constants to fluid properties
		with pressure/temperature dependencies.
	- improve symbolic constitutive law (based on GiNaC)
	- move exception handling towards <stdexcept>
	- review/improve user-configurable statistics output
	- add Matlab-compatible sparse matrix generation for sparse
	  matrix eigenvalue analysis (eigs)
	- add selected output streamed on sockets for interactive analysis
	- add rot2any/any2rot utilities



E. Bugs/missing features:

	- check for nested /* */ comments in parsers
	- eliminate nasty dependence from f2c typedefs (doublereal and so)
	- review deformable viscous/viscoelastic hinge according
	  to the elastic one



F. Documentation:

	- document the utilities in a separate man page
	- audit the user manual
