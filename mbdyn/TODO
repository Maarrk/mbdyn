A. Configuration:

	- test for '_' appended to F77 symbols
	- eliminate horrible blank lines in '--with-*'
	- audit all the suite for not-so-GNU systems
	- add test for crypt and put auth code in ifdefs & --with
	- add test for pow_dd stuff (might be needed by fortran code)
	- fix missing -lcrypt on some systems when configuring with pam



B. Package:

	- make compliant to GNU style
	- make 'make dist' work



C. Libraries:

	- add UMFPACK3 sparse matrix library
	- plot output in case of 'abort after: input;'



D. Code:

	- recover exisiting soft restart
	- implement binary, or hard, restart
	- add MATLAB/Octave and Simulink hooks.
		Small project: ``shell'' element, drive and so
		that executes unix commands including scripts,
		and especially matlab scripts.
		Medium project: ``matlab'' element that feeds matlab 
		with data structures containing variables and executes
		matlab code.
		Large project: turn mbdyn into a module for Simulink.
	- develop a trim control as an external command that drives
		a simulation.



E. Bugs/missing features:

	- check for nested /* */ comments in parsers
