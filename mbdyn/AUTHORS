Among the authors:

Prof. Paolo Mantegazza initiated the work on the F77 version of the code,
	which was a sort of proof-of-concept implementation.

Prof. Massimiliano Lanz worked on the initial, F77 version, called MBDin;
	he had an important role in adding the flexible elements, both
	beams and modal bodies. He also worked on the implementation
	wake aerodynamics, based on the code NUVOLA.

Prof. Gian Luca Ghiringhelli also worked on the F77 version, at the modal
	bodies and at the piezoelectric beams. He is working at present
	at the integration of landing gear stuff in the current version.
	He also contributed in adding the hydraulic part of the code.

Dr. Giampiero Bindolino had an important role in interfacing the initial
	F77 version with wake aerodynamics. We expect him to do the
	same in the new version!



Many students had a part in developing the code:

Dr. Gabriele Gilardi worked on the initial code as a PhD student, but I don't
	known what his exact contribution was.

Stefano Marazzani worked as an undergrad student at the beam, rotor 
	and aerodynamic  elements in the F77 version of the code.

Pierangelo Masarati (me!) worked as an undergraduate student at developing
	the control-related genels and at the piezoelectric beam elements.
	Then, as a PhD student, I entirely reengineered the program, by
	rewriting it in C++/C/F77, and added many control-related features.
	Now, as a Staff Researcher, I'm maintaining the code and developing
	new modules.

Felice Felippone, as an undergraduate student, implemented the modal body back
	in the new version of the code.

Lamberto Puggelli, another undergrad, implemented the hydraulic stuff

Giuseppe Quaranta (Beppe), as an undergrad, did a very good job in 
	parallelizingthe code adding a Schur domain decomposition solver
	and incorporating Metis as a partitioning tool, all under the
	MPI umbrella.

Leonardo Cassan, undergrad, is working at the ADAMS2MBDyn project,
	a translator form ADAMS/View models in adm format into MBDyn
	raw input files. You can find it in contrib/a2m.


Other undergrads might have had a role in the F77 version of the code, 
that I'm not aware of.

In some sense Paolo Mantegazza is the project leader,
and Pierangelo Masarati (me!) is the main developer.
