\chapter{Modal Element FEM File Format}
\label{sec:APP:EL:STRUCT:JOINT:MODAL:FORMAT}

This section describes the format of the FEM input to the \kw{modal}
joint of MBDyn, as resulting from the \kw{femgen} utility.
The usage of that utility has been already detailed 
in Section~\ref{sec:EL:STRUCT:JOINT:MODAL}; in short, it processes
binary output from NASTRAN, as defined by means of appropriate
ALTER files provided with MBDyn sources, into a file that is suitable
for direct input in MBDyn.
Since it is essentially a plain ASCII file, it is straightforward
to generate it from analogous results obtained with a different 
FEM software, from experiments or manually generated from analytical
or numerical models of any kind.

The format is:
{\small
\begin{verbatim}

** RECORD GROUP 1,<any comment; "HEADER">

\end{verbatim}
}

The blocks contain:
\begin{itemize}
\item \kw{RECORD GROUP 1}, a.k.a.\ the ``header'', contains a summary
of the contents of the file:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item \kw{<REV>} is a string that indicates the revision number;
	it is currently ignored;
	\item \kw{<NNODES>} is the number of (exposed) FEM nodes 
	in the FEM model;
	\item \kw{<NNORMAL>} is the number of normal modes;
	\item \kw{<NATTACHED>} is the number of ``attached'',
	i.e.\ static, modes;
	\item \kw{<NCONSTRAINT>} is the number of constraint modes;
	\item \kw{<NREJECTED>} is the number of rejected modes.
	\end{itemize}
	Currently, the number of available modes is computed as
	\begin{displaymath}
		\kw{NMODES} = \kw{NNORMAL} + \kw{NATTACHED}
			+ \kw{NCONSTRAINT} - \kw{NREJECTED}
	\end{displaymath}

\item \kw{RECORD GROUP 2} contains a listing of the \kw{<NNODES>} lables
of the (exposed) FEM nodes.

\item \kw{RECORD GROUP 3} contains the initial values of the \kw{<NMODES>}
modal unknowns;

\item \kw{RECORD GROUP 4} contains the initial values of the \kw{<NMODES>}
modal unknowns derivatives;

\item \kw{RECORD GROUP 5} contains the $X$ component of the position
of the \kw{<NNODES>} FEM nodes in the reference frame attached 
to the \kw{modal} node (or to the \kw{origin node}, if given).

\item \kw{RECORD GROUP 6} contains the $Y$ component of the data above;

\item \kw{RECORD GROUP 7} contains the $Z$ component of the data above;

\item \kw{RECORD GROUP 8} contains the non-orthogonalized components 
of the \kw{<NMODES>} modes; for each mode, the three components 
$X$, $Y$, $Z$ of the modal displacement, and the three components
$RX$, $RY$, $RZ$ of the linearized modal rotations are listed;
each mode shape is separated by a comment line, which typically is
\begin{verbatim}
**    NORMAL MODE SHAPE #  <N>
\end{verbatim}
for readability;

\item \kw{RECORD GROUP 9} contains the modal mass matrix,
i.e.\ a square, \kw{NMODES} times \kw{NMODES} matrix that contains
the reduced mass $\sqbr{m}$ resulting from the multiplication
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:modal-mass-constraint}
	\sqbr{m} = \cubr{X}^T \sqbr{M} \cubr{X}
\end{equation}
When only normal modes are used, it is diagonal.
It can be semi-definite positive, or even zero, if a partially 
or entirely static model is considered.

\item \kw{RECORD GROUP 10} contains the modal stiffness matrix,
i.e.\ a square, \kw{NMODES} times \kw{NMODES} matrix that contains
the reduced stiffness $\sqbr{k}$ resulting from the multiplication
\begin{displaymath}
	\sqbr{k} = \cubr{X}^T \sqbr{K} \cubr{X}
\end{displaymath}
When only normal modes are used, it is diagonal; in that case,
the diagonal contains the modal mass times the square 
of the eigenvalues, i.e.\ $k_{ii} = \omega_i^2 m_{ii}$.
It should be definite positive.

\item \kw{RECORD GROUP 11} contains the lumped inertia matrix
associated to the \kw{<NNODES>} (exposed) FEM nodes;
for each node, the $X$, $Y$, $Z$, $RX$, $RY$ and $RY$ inertia
coefficients are listed.
The resulting diagonal matrix must satisfy the constraint
illustrated in Equation~\ref{eq:modal-mass-constraint}.
\end{itemize}

Although the format loosely requires that no more than 6 numerical values 
appear on a single line, MBDyn is very forgiving about this and can parse
the input regardless of the formatting within each block.

An arbitrary number of comment lines may appear within blocks;
the beginning of a block is marked
\begin{verbatim}
** RECORD GROUP <DD>
\end{verbatim}
where the number \kw{<DD>} indicates what block is being read.
The size of each block, i.e.\ the number of values that are expected,
is defined based on the header block, so MBDyn should be able to detect
incomplete or mis-formatted files.

As an example, a very simple, hand-made FEM model file is presented below.
It models a FEM model made of three aligned nodes, where inertia 
is only associated to the mid-node.
As a consequence, the three mode shapes must be interpreted as static
shapes, since the modal mass matrix is null.
Note that each line is prefixed with a two-digit line number 
that is not part of the iput file.
Also, for readability, all comments are prefixed by ``\kw{**}''
like the mandatory ``\kw{** RECORD GROUP}'' lines, although not required 
by the format of the file.
