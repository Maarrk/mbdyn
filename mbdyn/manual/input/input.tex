\chapter{Introduction}
This paper describes the format of the input data for MBDyn: 
Multi-body Analysis program.
It should be considered a syntax more than a format, since the rules of the
input allow a lot of freedom in the file format. 

\vspace{10mm}%
\emph{
Note: throughout the manual, a (sometimes na\"{\i}ve) 
Backus-Naur-like sintax description is used. 
Extensions are made, such as to put extra arguments in square brackets
\texttt{[]}, mutually exclusive arguments in curl brackets \texttt{\{\}},
separated by the logical ``or'' \texttt{|} operator.
Non-terminal symbols are enclosed in angle brackets \texttt{<>}, while
terminal symbols are written in normal types.
The association of a non-terminal with terminal or non-terminal
symbols is performed by means of the operator `\texttt{::=}'. 
% Special characters are enclosed in simple quotes \texttt{`}, and \texttt{'}.
When required, the type of a non-terminal symbol is enforced in a ``C''
programming language casting style, by prepending a (usually
self-explanatory) type enclosed in plain brackets \texttt{()}.

\chapter{Remarks}
The input of the program MBDyn is subject to continuous changes, since the
code is under development.
This documentation tries to give some insight into the logics that drove
the implementation of such an input.
Many things are ``as they are'' only because they were made in a hurry, 
or because no better way was at hand at the moment they were made.
In changing the input format and syntax of many parts, an effort 
will be made to maintain as much backwards compatibility as possible,
or at least a reliable error check that warns for possible erroneous 
inputs due to a change in the input format. 
At present the input of MBDyn already warns for many possible errors 
and makes as many cross-checks on the consistency of the data. 
Nearly every warning and error issue shows the line of the input file 
where the error occurred. 
Unfortunately, now that multiple files can be scanned by means of the 
\texttt{include} directive, the file where the error occurred is not clear 
any more, unless a reliable C++ exception handling is supported by the
compiler.
This paper will be subject to changes too, so provide you always have the
latest one, or better, a release that is up-to-date with the version of the
code you're running. \\
