\chapter{Introduction}
This document describes the format of the input data for MBDyn ---
Multi-body Analysis program.
It should be considered a syntax more than a format, since the rules of the
input allow a lot of freedom in the file format. 

\section{Conventions on the Notation}
throughout the manual, a (sometimes na\"{\i}ve) 
Backus-Naur-like syntax description is used. 
Extensions are made, such as to put extra arguments in square brackets
\kw{[]}, mutually exclusive arguments in curl brackets \kw{\{\}},
separated by the logical ``or'' \kw{|} operator.
Non-terminal symbols are enclosed in angle brackets \kw{<>}, while
terminal symbols are written in normal types.
The association of a non-terminal with terminal or non-terminal
symbols is performed by means of the operator `\kw{::=}'. 
% Special characters are enclosed in simple quotes \kw{`}, and \kw{'}.
When required, the type of a non-terminal symbol is enforced in a ``C''
programming language casting style, by prepending a (usually
self-explanatory) type enclosed in plain brackets \kw{()}.


\section{Remarks}
The input of the program MBDyn is subject to continuous changes
at a fast pace, since the code is under development.
This documentation attempts to give some insight into the logics 
that drove the implementation of such an input.
While most of the software resulted from a careful design, 
some portions are ``as they are'' only because they were made in a hurry, 
or because no better way was at hand at the moment they were made.
The input format partially reflects the development of the software.
In changing the input format and syntax of many parts, an effort 
will be made to make it as much backward compatible as possible,
or at least a reliable error checking will be put in place that warns 
for possible erroneous inputs due to a change in the input format. 
At present the input of MBDyn already warns for many possible errors 
and makes as many cross-checks as possible on the consistency of the data. 
Nearly every warning and error issue shows the line of the input file 
where the error occurred. 
Since at present multiple files can be scanned by means of the 
\kw{include} directive, the file where the error occurred
may not be clearly indicated if no reliable C++ exception handling 
is supported by the compiler.
This document will be subject to changes, so be sure you always have 
a release that is aligned with the version of the code you're running.
