\chapter{Data}\label{sec:DATA}
The \kw{data} section is read directly by the driver program. It is
included between the cards:
\begin{verbatim}
    begin: data;
        ...
    end: data;
\end{verbatim}
At present it is used only to select the integrator to be used in the
simulation. 
Since the only available integrator is the multistep one, the only active 
card (optional, at present), is:
\begin{verbatim}
    <card> ::= integrator: multistep;
\end{verbatim}
Anyway, the \kw{data} section \underline{must} be present.
