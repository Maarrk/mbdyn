module-imu.cc

implements two uses of a IMU:

ModuleIMU ("imu") mimics an IMU by sending to the output
the measures of a strapdown IMU (angular velocity and acceleration
components in a reference frame attached to the chassis of the sensor),
making them also available as private data.

ModuleIMUConstraint ("imu constraint") prescribes the angular velocity
and the acceleration of the point it is attached to.

In both cases the IMU can be rigidly offset and oriented with respect
to the structural node it is attached to.
