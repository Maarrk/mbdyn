				 Massimiliano Lanz <lanz@aero.polimi.it>
 - native and c81 unsteady aerodynamic forces work with "Bielawa" model

*** Sun Jan 13 09:04:22 CET 2002 Pierangelo Masarati <masarati@aero.polimi.it>
 - actually there's no need to reset the matrix as we know in advance
   if we're adding/subtracting a coefficient for the first time; all
   we need to do is reset the hash vector.
 - y12m promoted back to default as it saves some 20-25% time on average
   test cases; umfpack3 has a more versatile memory handling and is less 
   sensitive to pivoting issues.

*** Sat Jan 12 10:47:06 CET 2002 Pierangelo Masarati <masarati@aero.polimi.it>
 - memset allows some 0.5% speedup!

*** Fri Jan 11 17:38:50 CET 2002 Pierangelo Masarati <masarati@aero.polimi.it>
				 Marco Morandini <morandini@aero.polimi.it>
 - optimal storage allocation for y12m wrapper (dramatic performance 
   improvement; need to do the same for Harwell)

*** Thu Jan 10 11:10:55 CET 2002 Pierangelo Masarati <masarati@aero.polimi.it>
 - std::ified all the package
 - major reworking of configuration/system detection/header handling

*** Tue Jan  8 19:27:59 CET 2002 Giuseppe Quaranta <quaranta@aero.polimi.it>
				 Marco Morandini <morandini@aero.polimi.it>
 - added support for Umfpack3 (parallel build is broken)

*** Tue Dec 11 14:11:59 CET 2001 Pierangelo Masarati <masarati@aero.polimi.it>
 - added "bdf" option to integration methods also for dummy steps

 - moved RotorTrim in mbdyn/elec; still to check.
 - found out that clapack allows dgegv to work correctly! now need
   to define output interface and implement AssEig for ALL elements!
 - Made a simple trick to allow aerodynamic elements to receive induced
   velocity from rotor elements without contributing forces.
 - Adding getopt, dgegv stuff in libraries/libobjs directory.

*** Thu Oct 12 15:01:33 CEST 2000 Leonardo Cassan
				  Pierangelo Masarati <masarati@aero.polimi.it>

*** 1999-01-26 Pierangelo Masarati & Lamberto Puggelli:
 - Hydraulic nodes added and tested (directly derived from ScaladAlgebraicNode,
   they can be used with genels).
   
*** 1999-01-25 Pierangelo Masarati:
