1.1.1
	- There's a library cross-dependency that's not appropriately 
	  handled by recent versions of libtool (e.g. 1.4.1).
	  libbase.a must be linked twice (at lòeast on Linux with gcc 3.1)
	  but recent libtools detect the duplicate linking and remove
	  the first occurrence.  It has been temporarily fixed by 
	  deceiving libtool with a simple trick, but it is likely
	  this will be removed in the future.  In the meanwhile we'll
	  figure out a clean way to avoid the double linking.
	  Everything works fine with libtool 1.3.4.
