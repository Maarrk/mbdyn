# Information about Google Summer of Code

MBDyn plans to partecipate to the 2020 edition of the [Google Summer of Code](http://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)!
If you are interested in partecipating with us, and if the project is selected, here you can find information about:
  * [Project Ideas](https://gitlab.polimi.it/Pub/mbdyn/blob/master/manual/gsoc/Project-Ideas.md)
  * [Our Entry Test](https://gitlab.polimi.it/Pub/mbdyn/blob/master/manual/gsoc/Entry-Test.md)
  * [FAQs](https://gitlab.polimi.it/Pub/mbdyn/blob/master/manual/gsoc/Frequently-Asked-Questions.md)

Please remember that participation in GSoC with MBDyn is not something you can improvise.  You must have adequate programming skills and knowledge of the project.  Please do not ask us to "help you understand how the project works".  If you can't pass the entry test, then likely you are not a good candidate, and there is very little we can do to help you (not to mention the fact that we have limited time, and - sad, but true - better ways to spend it).
